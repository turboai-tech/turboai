            <strong>User-Initiated Sharing:</strong> When you use active sharing

          <strong>Please note:</strong> Our Services may include links to
          third-party websites (such as social media), whose privacy policies
          are independent of ours. Please be aware that when you leave
          <strong className="text-primary"> turboai</strong> Services for other
          websites or use other services, even if accessed through links
          provided by <strong className="text-primary"> turboai</strong>, we

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">4. Security</h2>
        <p>
          We have implemented a series of reasonable technical, administrative,
          and organizational measures aimed at comprehensively protecting the
          security of your personal information. These protective measures cover
          both online and offline environments, with the purpose of preventing
          the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or
          destruction of your personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, we must honestly point out that in today&apos;s digital
          world, no security system can provide absolute 100% protection.
          Therefore, when using our Services, you need to understand and accept
          this reality: despite our best efforts to protect your information,
          the risks associated with using our Services ultimately must be borne
          by you personally.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">5. Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to
          provide the Services, fulfill legal obligations, or protect relevant
          rights. We consider factors such as when the information was
          collected, service requirements, legal requirements, and security
          factors to determine retention periods. When information is no longer
          needed or you request deletion, we will promptly process it. We are
          committed to respecting your control over your personal data while
          meeting our business needs.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-lg font-bold my-2">
          6. Children&apos;s Personal Information
        </h2>
        <p>

          do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from
          children. According to our Terms of Service, all users must be at

          transfer, store, and process your personal information worldwide
          (including in the European Union, United Kingdom, and United States).
          For residents of the European Union, Switzerland, or the United
          Kingdom, we strictly adhere to lawful data transfer mechanisms, such
          as the European Commission&apos;s Standard Contractual Clauses and
          relevant local regulations (such as the UK&apos;s International Data
          Transfer Addendum), ensuring your personal data receives appropriate
          protection during cross-border transfers.
